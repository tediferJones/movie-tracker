# movie-tracker

### Keep track of all your favorite movies and tv shows
- Use watch records to keep track of when and how many times a user has watched something
- Use lists to currate and organize your media
  - Lists can then be viewed in a table that allows you to sort and filter based on certain criteria
- Revews can provide a short description, user rating, and weather that user thinks the movie is worth watching again
- All user profiles are public, which allows you to see what other people are watching

### Potential future features
- Streaming availability
  - Allow users to input what streaming services they have and what media is currently available on those streaming platforms
