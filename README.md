# movie-tracker

### Keep track of all your favorite movies and tv shows
- Use watch records to keep track of when and how many times a user has watched something
- Use lists to currate and organize your media
  - Lists can then be viewed in a table that allows you to sort and filter based on certain criteria
- Reviews can provide a short description, user rating, and weather that user thinks the movie is worth watching again
- All user profiles are public, which allows you to see what other people are watching

### Potential future features
- Streaming availability
  - Allow users to input what streaming services they have access to and then allow
    users to sort/view what media is currently available on those streaming platforms
- User privacy settings
  - Allow a user to set certain lists or their entire profile to private so other users can't view their information
- Create a ranking system for lists, instead of only allowing a single default list
